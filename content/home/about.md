# About me

I'm an Electrical Engineering PhD Candidate at Stanford University.
I am interested currently in nanophotonic computing, specifically the development of nanophotonic elements for machine learning and optimization applications.
My project is currently in an early stage and focuses specifically on:
1. theoretical limits of silicon Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI) meshes (size and energy efficiency) for deep learning and model deployment
2. fabrication of MEMS phase shifters to minimize energy usage and miniaturize the MZI design for scalable nanophotonic machine learning.
